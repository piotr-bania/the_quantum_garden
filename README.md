## Overview

"The Quantum Garden" is an interactive 3D experience that illustrates a quantum computer's architecture through geometric forms and connections. This project aims to provide an educational insight into quantum computing while showcasing the capabilities of WebGL and React in creating engaging web experiences.

## Features

- **3D Geometric Models**: Visual representations of qubits as interconnected geometric shapes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Users can engage with the quantum bits and witness the state of superposition and entanglement.
- **Educational Tool**: A creative approach to explaining complex quantum computing principles.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for production.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **Blender**: For creating and exporting 3D models.
- **GLTF**: The chosen format for 3D model export.
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting.
